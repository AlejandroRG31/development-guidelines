# Trello usage

Usually one card per task (if there are related task you can link the cards as attachments); or even create an `Epic` card to group several related cards.

1. Before starting a task (card), read carefully the description and comments. **Ask if you have questions** before start writing code.
2. Keep updated the card column according to its state (backlog, to-do, doing, testing...).
3. Document the changes of the task on the card (leave comments, update checklists...).
4. Add links to related PR/issues of GitHub; if you are working on a GitHub issue/PR that doesn't have a card on trello just create a new card.
