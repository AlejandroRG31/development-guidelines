# development-guidelines

**WIP: this is a draft**

Code style: [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)


## Development cicles
https://basecamp.com/shapeup
3 + 1 ???

## Repository branches
https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com

- tag releases
- develop features on new branches (feature branch)
- fix bugs on new branches


## Testing
Test Driven Development.
1. Before fixing a bug, write a test that reproduces the issue.
2. Before developing a new feature, write a test that describes the expected behaviour on  different conditions and states.
3. If some code cannot be tested, refactor it until it can.
